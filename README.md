# surfs_up

## OVERVIEW

This analysis aims to assess and identify temperature trends in Oahu, Hawaii, for the months of June and December, over a seven-year period. It was prepared in order to evaluate the sustainability of a year-round surf and ice cream shop business.

The weather data provided was stored in a SQLite database, and so SQLalchemy was used to facilitate communication between Python and the database. The stastistical analysis was completed using Pandas.
